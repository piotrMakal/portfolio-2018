    <h2>My First Real-time Renderer</h2>

<p>
    In late 2015, after a few months of learning OpenGL, I wrote my very first simple real-time renderer in C++, with the help of GLEW, SDL, GLM and boost. Renderer implements most basic features like: Lambert and Phong shaders, textures with alphas, normal maps, different types of light (ambient, point, spot and directional) with depth map shadows, orbiting camera and more.

<h2>Toltec</h2>

<p>
    Toltec is my project for learning purposes that I was working on in 2016 and 2017 in my spare time. The goal was to create multi-context, multi-threaded 3D modeling application with a support for different rendering systems (one of which was inspired by Autodesk Maya Viewport 2.0). For this project I used C++ with Qt, glbinding and GLM. Currently this project is suspended/cancelled due to its complexity vs. little time I could spend on it. Source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/piotrMakal/toltec">my GitHub</a>.

<h2>Custom Axis Orientation in Degrees (Maya Script)</h2>

</div>
<p>
    Python script for Autodesk Maya that I wrote in 2013. Back then Maya users have to type custom axis for move, rotate and scale tool using radians, which was wierd. This script became somewhat obsolete in 2015 when Autodesk Maya finally switched to degrees in that subject, although script may be still usefull in certain situations.

<p>
    Python scirpt with a goal to extend Maya export capabilities. Unfortunately never had time to implement logic for it, so only GUI have been written using PySide.

<h2>Instrument Cluster Prototypes</h2>
<p>
    During 2017 and 2018 I designed and partially implemented (using Qt/QML) three instrument clusters prototypes. Well... I would just call those 'sketches'.

<p>
    Above speedometer was designed in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, animation was done using Autodesk Maya and Adobe After Effects. For Maya I also wrote small node using Autodesk Maya Python API 2.0 that was responsible for calculating speed based on a position of a guage, so I wouldn't do this manualy.

    Above simple speedometer was a test of Qt Quick and QML I have been learning for a few months.

<p>
    Above instrument cluster sketch was inspired by sci-fi movies from the 70's and 80's like Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982). Those early prototypes definitely lack animations and so called 'VHS effect', but if you have a good imagination you should see where this is going. And to just realize how much of a difference such things can make, look at those pieces from the <i>Alien: Isolation</i> game.

<p>
    Renders of a unfinished model that will serve as a part of a promo graphic for Maya Wire Plugin. Used 3D scaned model of a hand, remodeled it to fit my artistic vision in Autodesk Maya and Autodesk Meshmixer, rendered with Arnold.
